# MACS: Multi Domain Adaptation Facilitates Accurate Connectomics Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of **MACS**, a deep learning framework for connectomics segmentation that introduces the first ever multi-domain adaptation method for connectomics and achieves robust and accurate segmentation performance across diverse connectomics EM datasets.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abrarrahmanabir/MACS.git
cd MACS
```


##  Training

To train the model on a selected problem instance, simply run:
```bash
python run.py

```
